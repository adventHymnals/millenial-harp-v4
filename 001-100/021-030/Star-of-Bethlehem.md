    1. 
    When marshall’d on the nightly plain, 
    The glittering hosts bestud the sky, 
    One star alone, of all the train, 
    Can fix the sinner’s wandering eye: 
    Hark! Hark! to God the chorus breaks, 
    From ev’ry host, from ev’ry gem; 
    But one alone, the Savior speaks, 
    It is the star of Bethlehem.

    2. 
    Once on the raging seas I rode, 
    The storm was loud, the night was dark, 
    The ocean yawn’d, and rudely blow’d 
    The wind that toss’d my foundering bark. 
    Deep horror then my vitals froze, 
    Death struck-I ceased the tide to stem: 
    When suddenly a star arose, 
    It was the Star of Bethlehem.

    3. 
    It was my guide, my light, my all, 
    It bade my dark foreboding cease; 
    And thro’ the storm and danger’s thrall, 
    It led me to the port of peace. 
    Now safely moor’d-my perils o’er, 
    I’ll sing first in night’s diadem, 
    Forever and forevermore, 
    The Star-the Star of Bethlehem.
