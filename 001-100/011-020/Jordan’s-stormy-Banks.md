    1. 
    On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand, 
    And cast a wishful eye, 
    To Canaan’s fair and happy land, 
    Where my possessions lie. 
    O, the transporting, rapturous scene, 
    That rises To my sight! 
    Sweet fields array’d in living green, 
    And rivers of delight.

    2. 
    There gen’rous fruits that never fail, 
    On trees immortal grow; 
    There rocks and hills and brooks and vale, 
    With milk and honey flow. 
    All o’er those wide extended plains, 
    Shines one eternal day; 
    There God the Son forever reigns, 
    And scatters night away.

    3. 
    No chilling winds, or poisonous breath 
    Can reach that healthful shore; 
    Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, 
    Are felt and feared no more. 
    When shall I reach that happy place, 
    And be forever blest? 
    When shall I see my Father’s face, 
    And in his bosom rest?

    4. 
    Fill’d with delight, my raptured soul 
    Would here no longer stay; 
    Though Jordan’s waves around me roll, 
    Fearless I’d launch away. 
    There on those high and flowery plains, 
    Our spirits ne’er shall tire; 
    But in perpetual, joyful strains, 
    Redeeming love admire.
