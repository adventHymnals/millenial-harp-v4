    1. 
    Children of the heavenly King, 
    As ye journey sweetly sing; 
    Sing your Savior’s worthy praise, 
    Glorious in his works and ways. 
    We are traveling home to God, 
    In the way the fathers trod; 
    They are happy now and we 
    Soon their happiness shall see.

    2. 
    Shout ye little flock, and blest, 
    You near Jesus throne shall rest; 
    There your seats are now prepared, 
    There your kingdom and reward. 
    Fear not, brethren, joyful stand 
    On the borders of your land: 
    Jesus Christ, your Father’s son, 
    Bids you undismay’d go on.
