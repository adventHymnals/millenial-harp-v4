    1. 
    As on the cross the Savior hung, 
    And wept, and bled, and died. 
    He poured salvation on a wretch 
    That languished at his side.

    2. 
    His crimes with inward grief and shame, 
    The penitent confessed; 
    Then turned his dying eyes to Christ, 
    And thus his prayer addressed;

    3. 
    ‘Jesus thou Son and heir of heaven, 
    ‘Thou spotless Lamb of God, 
    ‘ I see thee bathed in sweat and tears, 
    ‘And weltering in thy blood.

    4. 
    ‘Yet quickly from these scenes of wo, 
    ‘In triumph thou shalt rise, 
    ‘Burst through the gloomy shades of death, 
    And shine above the skies.’

    5. 
    ‘Amid the glories of that world, 
    ‘Dear Savior, think on me; 
    ‘And in the vict’ries of thy death, 
    ‘May I a sharer be.’

    6. 
    His prayer the dying Jesus heard 
    And instantly replied, 
    ‘To-day thy parting soul shall be 
    ‘With me in paradise.’
