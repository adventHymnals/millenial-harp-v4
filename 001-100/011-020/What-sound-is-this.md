    From the Wesleyan Harp

    1. 
    What sound is this salutes my ear? 
    ‘Tis Gabriel’s trump methinks I hear, 
    ‘Tis Gabriel’s trump methinks I hear; 
    The expected day has come. 
    Behold the heav’ns, the earth, the sea, 
    Proclaim the year of Jubilee, 
    Proclaim the year of Jubilee, 
    Return, ye exiles, home.

    2. 
    Behold the fair Jerusalem, 
    IIluminated by the Lamb, 
    Illuminated by the Lamb, 
    In glory doth appear. 
    Fair Zion rising from the tombs, 
    To meet the Bridegroom, lo! he comes, 
    To meet the Bridegroom, lo! he comes, 
    And hails the festive year.

    3. 
    My soul is striving to be there; 
    I long to rise and wing the air, 
    And trace the sacred road. 
    Adieu, adieu, all earthly things; 
    O that I had an angel’s wings, 
    I’d quickly see my God.

    4. 
    Fly, lingering moments, fly, O fly, 
    I thirst, I pant, I long to try, 
    Angelic joys to prove! 
    Soon shall I quit this house of clay, 
    Clap my glad wings and soar away, 
    And shout redeeming love.
