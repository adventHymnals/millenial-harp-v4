    1. 
    Alas! and did my Savior bleed? 
    And did my Jesus die? 
    Would he devote that sacred head 
    For such a worm as I?

    2. 
    Thy body slain, sweet Jesus, thine, 
    And bath’d in its own blood, 
    While all exposed to wrath of men, 
    The glorious Sufferer stood!

    3. 
    Was it for crimes that I had done, 
    He groaned upon the tree? 
    Amazing pity! grace unknown! 
    And love beyond degree!

    4. 
    Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
    And shut his glories in, 
    When Christ the glorious Savior died, 
    For man, the creature’s sin.

    5. 
    Thus might I hide my blushing face, 
    While his dear cross appears, 
    Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
    And melt mine eyes in tears.

    6. 
    But drops of grief can ne’er repay 
    The debt of love I owe; 
    Here, Lord, I give myself away; 
    ‘Tis all that I can do.
