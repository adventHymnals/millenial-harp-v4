    1. 
    O turn ye, O turn ye, for why will ye die? 
    Since God in great mercy is coming so high; 
    Since Jesus invites you, the Spirit says, Come, 
    And angels are waiting to welcome you home.

    2. 
    Come now to the banquet and make no delay, 
    For Christ bids you welcome, he bids you to-day: 
    Come wretched, come, starving, come just as you be, 
    While streams of salvations are flowing so free.
