    1. 
    The God of Abraham praise, 
    Who reigns enthron’d above 
    Ancient of everlasting days, 
    And God of love; 
    Jehovah, Great I Am! 
    By earth and heav’n confess’d; 
    I bow and bless the sacred name, 
    Forever bless’d.

    2. 
    The God of Abraham praise, 
    At whose supreme command 
    From earth I rise-and seek the joys 
    At his right hand: 
    I all on earth forsake, 
    Its wisdom, fame, and power, 
    And him my only portion make, 
    My shield and tower.

    3. 
    The God of Abraham praise; 
    Whose all-sufficient grace 
    Shall guide me all my happy days, 
    In all his ways: 
    He calls a worm his friend. 
    He calls himself my God! 
    And he shall save me to the end. 
    Through Jesus’ blood.

    4. 
    He by Himself hath sworn, 
    I on his oath depend, 
    I shall on eagles’ wings upborne 
    To Heaven ascend: 
    I shall behold his face, 
    I shall his power adore, 
    And sing the wonders of his grace 
    Forevermore.
