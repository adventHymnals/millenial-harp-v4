[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JVLTKbRjGYfGIl1zK66r_ZbH9mq8yT2i/edit?mode=html)



    Don’t you see my Jesus coming? 
    See him come in yonder cloud, 
    With ten thousand angels round him, 
    How they of my Jesus crowd. 
    I am bound for the kingdom, 
    Will you go to glory with me. 
    Hallelujah, O Hallelujah, 
    I’m bound for the kingdom, 
    will you go to glory with me, 
    Hallelujah, O praise ye the Lord.
