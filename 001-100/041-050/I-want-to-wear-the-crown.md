    1. 
    Jesus, my all to heav’n is gone; 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    He whom I fix my hopes upon; 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Oh my heart says praise the Lord, 
    my heart says praise the Lord, 
    my heart says praise the Lord, 
    I want to wear the crown.

    2. 
    The way the holy prophets went, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    The road that leads from banishment; 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Oh my heart says praise the Lord, 
    my heart says praise the Lord, 
    my heart says praise the Lord, 
    I want to wear the crown.

    3. 
    His track I see, and I’ll pursue, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    The narrow way, till him I view, 
    I want to wear the crown; 
    Oh my heart says, etc.

    4. 
    The King’s highway of holiness, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    I’ll go, for all his paths are peace. 
    I want to wear the crown. 
    Oh my heart says, etc.

    5. 
    Lo! glad I come, and thou, blest Lamb, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Shalt take me to thee whose I am; 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Oh my heart says, etc.

    6. 
    Nothing but sin have I to give, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Nothing but love shall I receive. 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Oh my heart says praise, etc.

    7. 
    Then will I tell to sinners round, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    What a dear Savior I have found, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Oh my heart says, etc.

    8. 
    I’ll point to thy redeeming blood, 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    And say, ‘Behold the way to God!’ 
    I want to wear the crown, 
    Oh my heart says, etc.
