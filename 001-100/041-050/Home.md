    Dolce. 
    1 
    Oh! Land of rest, for thee I sigh, 
    When will the moment come, 
    When I shall lay my armor by, 
    And dwell with Christ at home.

    2. 
    No tranquil joys on earth I know, 
    No peaceful sheltering dome; 
    This world’s a wilderness of wo, 
    This world is not my home.

    3. 
    To Jesus Christ I sought for rest, 
    He bade me cease to roam; 
    And fly for succor to his breast, 
    And he’d conduct me home.

    4. 
    I would at once have quit this place, 
    Where foes in fury roam, 
    But ah! my passport was not sealed, 
    I could not yet go home.

    5. 
    When by afflictions sharply tried, 
    I view the gaping tomb; 
    Although I dread death’s chilling flood, 
    Yet still I sigh for home.

    6. 
    Weary of wandering round and round, 
    This vale of sin and gloom; 
    I long to leave th’unhallowed ground, 
    And dwell with Christ at home.
