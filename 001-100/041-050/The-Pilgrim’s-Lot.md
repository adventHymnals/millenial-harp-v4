    1. 
    How happy is the pilgrim’s lot, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    How free from ev’ry anxious thought, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan. 
    O Canaan! bright Canaan! 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    O Canaan, it is my happy home, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan.

    2. 
    Nothing on earth I call my own, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    A stranger to the world unknown, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    O Canaan, etc.

    3. 
    I trample on the whole delight, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    And seek a city out of sight, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    O Canaan, etc.

    4. 
    There is my house and portion fair, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    My treasure and my heart are there, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    O Canaan, etc.

    5. 
    For me my elder brethren stay, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    And angels beckon me away, 
    I am bound for the land of Canaan, 
    O Canaan, etc.
