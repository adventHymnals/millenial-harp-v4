    1. 
     The night is wearing fast away, 
     A streak of light is dawning, 
    Sweet harbinger of that bright day, 
    The fair Millennial morning. 
     Gloomy and dark the night has been, 
    And long the way, and dreary;  
    And sad the weeping saints are seen, 
    And faint, and worn and weary.

    2. 
     Ye mourning pilgrims, cease your tears, 
     
    f The light of that bright morn appears,— 
    The long sabbatic morrow. 
     Lift up your heads—behold from far 
    A flood of splendor streaming! 
    It is the bright and Morning-Star, 
    In living lustre beaming!

    3. 
    And see that star-like host around 
    Of angel bands, attending; 
    Hark! hark! the trumpet’s glad’ning sound, 
    ‘Mid shouts triumphant blending. 
    He comes, the Bridegroom promised long- 
    Go forth with joy to meet him; 
    And raise the new and nuptial song, 
    In cheerful strains to greet him.

    4. 
    Adorn thyself, the feast prepare, 
    While bridal strains are swelling; 
    He comes, with thee all joys to share, 
    And make this earth his dwelling. 
     Lift up your heads-behold from far 
    A flood of splendor streaming! 
    It is the bright and Morning-Star, 
    In living lustre beaming!
