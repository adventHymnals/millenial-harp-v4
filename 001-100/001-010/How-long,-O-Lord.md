    1. 
    “How long, O Lord, how long?”— 
    It was in heav’n 
    That prayerful voice was heard, 
    From souls forgiven.

    2. 
    Was heaven not enough? 
    Happy, secure, 
    Robed in eternal bliss 
    Would they have more.

    3. 
    Jesus! they would have more- 
    Even in bliss, 
    The souls expectant wait 
    More happiness.

    4. 
    They wait, even in heaven, 
    Impatiently, 
    To see this troubled world 
    At peace with thee.

    5. 
    They would behold their King, 
    Once crucified, 
    Mistrusted still, disowned, 
    And still denied,—

    6. 
    Jesus! they would behold 
    Thy work complete, 
    And misery and sin 
    Beneath thy feet.

    7. 
    And may not we, too, join 
    In heaven’s song? 
    Should we alone not ask, 
    “How long, how long?”
