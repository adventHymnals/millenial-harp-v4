    1. 
    How long, O Lord our Savior, 
    Wilt thou remain away? 
    Our hearts are growing weary 
    Of thy so long delay. 
    O when shall come the moment 
    When, brighter far than morn, 
    The sunshine of thy glory 
    Shall on thy people dawn?

    2. 
    How long, O gracious Master, 
    Wilt thou thy household leave? 
    So long hast thou now tarried, 
    Few thy return believe, 
    Immers’d in sloth and folly, 
    Thy servants Lord, we see; 
    And few of us stand ready 
    With joy to welcome thee.

    3. 
    How long, O heav’nly Bridegroom, 
    How long wilt thou delay? 
    And yet how few are grieving 
    That thou dost absent stay! 
    Thy very Bride her portion 
    And calling hath forgot, 
    And seeks for ease and glory 
    Where thou, her Lord, art not.

    4. 
    O wake thy slumbering virgins; 
    Send forth the solemn cry, 
    Let alt thy saints repeat it, 
    “The Bridegroom draweth nigh!” 
    May all our lamps be burning, 
    Our loins well girded be, 
    Each longing heart preparing 
    With joy thy face to see.
