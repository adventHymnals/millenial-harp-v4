    1. 
    There in an hour of peaceful rest, 
    To mourning wander’rs given; 
    There is a joy for souls distress’d, 
    A balm for every wounded breast, 
    ‘Tis found alone in heaven.

    2. 
    There is a soft, a downy bed, 
    As fair as breath of even; 
    A couch for weary mortals spread, 
    Where they may rest the aching head, 
    And find repose in heaven.

    3. 
    There is a home for weary souls, 
    By sin and sorrow driven; 
    When tossed on life’s tempestuous shoals, 
    Where storms arise and ocean rolls 
    And all is drear-but heaven.

    4. 
    There faith lifts up the tearless eye, 
    To brighter prospects given; 
    It views the tempest passing by, 
    Sees evening shadows quickly fly, 
    And all serene-in heaven.

    5. 
    There fragrant flowers immortal bloom, 
    And joys supreme are given; 
    There rays divine disperse the gloom:— 
    Beyond the dark, the narrow tomb 
    Appears the dawn of heaven.
