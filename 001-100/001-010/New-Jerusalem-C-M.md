Lo, what a glorious sight appears,\
To our believing eyes;\
'The earth and seas are passed away,\
And the old rolling skies!\

On Canaan's happy shore.\
'Tis there we'll meet at Jesus' feet,\
When we meet to part no more.\

The new Jerusalem comes down,\
Adorn'd with shining grace.\

Attending angels shout for joy,\

Of your, etc.\
Mortals behold the sacred sear\
Of your descending King!\

Removes his blest abode;\
Men are the objects of his love,\
And he their gracious God.
