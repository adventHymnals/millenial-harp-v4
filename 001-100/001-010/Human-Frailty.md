    1. 
    This world is all a fleeting show, 
    For man’s probation given; 
    The smiles of joy, the tears of wo, 
    Deceitful shine, deceitful flow; 
    There’s nothing true as heaven.

    2. 
    Poor wanderers of a stormy day, 
    From wave to wave we’er driven; 
    And fancy’s flash, and reason’s ray 
    Serve but to light us on the way; 
    There’s nothing bright as heaven.

    3. 
    And where’s the hand held out to cheer 
    The heart with anguish riven? 
    For sorrow’s sigh, and trouble’s tear, 
    Have never found a refuge here; 
    There’s nothing kind as heaven.

    4. 
    In vain do mortals sigh for bliss, 
    Without their sins forgiven: 
    True pleasure, everlasting peace, 
    Are only found in God’s free grace; 
    There’s nothing good as heaven.

    5. 
    From those who walk in wisdom’s way, 
    Corroding fears are driven; 
    They’re wash’d in Christ’s atoning blood, 
    Enjoy communion with their God, 
    And find their way to heaven.
