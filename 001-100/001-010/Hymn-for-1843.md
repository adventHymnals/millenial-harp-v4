    1. 
    The clouds at length are breaking; 
    The dawn will soon appear, 
    And “Signs” there’s no mistaking, 
    Proclaim Messiah near. 
    Awake, awake from sleeping, 
    Attend the “midnight cry,” 
    Ye saints, refrain from weeping, 
    Your Great Deliverer’s nigh

    2. 
    The morning light is beaming; 
    The “day-star” shines on high, 
    Christ’s Heralds are proclaiming 
    His coming in the sky; 
    And earth’s eventful story 
    A few short months will tell, 
    The righteous rise to glory; 
    The wicked sink to hell.

    3. 
    If earth and all her treasure, 
    Are doom’d to fire and flame; 
    Her Royal pomp, and pleasure 
    Are but an  
    Her Kings-her Crowns-her glory 
    Her Armies-Fleets-and pride, 
    May bubble forth her story 
    While floating down the tide.

    4. 
    The Ocean, Oh! the ocean, 
    To which  grandeurs tend 
    Now foams in dreadful motion, 
    Her boast and pomp to end. 
    See, see, the flames ascending, 
    The seas, themselves explode; 
    The clouds,—the skies, are rending 
    With cries of—‘God’—‘Oh! God’!!

    5. 
    Oh! hear the sad petition, 
    “Rocks crush us into dust;” 
    Oh! pity our condition- 
    Or  we surely must 
    We thought that we were wiser 
    Than  and all 
    Yet Sinner—Sceptic—miser— 
    Must suffer once for all.

    6. 
    Ye mortals take the warning, 
    Ten thousand calls invite; 
    Should you neglect the morning 
    Then comes the  
    Now mercy’s hand extended. 
    The vilest wretch would save; 
    But Oh! if  be ended 
    You’re lost beyond the grave.

    7. 
    Great Author of compassion 
    Redeemer-Saviour-friend- 
    Oh! send to every nation 
    The knowledge of its end; 
    Fly! fly on wings of morning, 
    Ye who the truth can tell, 
    And sound the awful warning, 
    To rescue souls from
